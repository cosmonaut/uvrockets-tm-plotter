uvrockets-tm-plotter
====================

This program is intended to become a real-time plotter of sub-orbital
rocket telemetry data via serial (or usb serial) stream. The idea is
to have a microcontroller or something similar aboard the payload
keepking track of various voltages, currents, temperatures, and
pressures which are then sent via serial stream to a computer
employing this plotter. This will allow easy monitoring of vital
payload data during tests and potentially during flight with
configurable graphs and Qt widgets.


More info to come later -- this is currently a (working) demo. The
demo is set to plot afproto packets that have two payload bytes
representing a 16-bit temperature value as read by an internal AVR
sensor.
